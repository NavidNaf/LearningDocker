# LearningDocker
I have started learning docker, quite a few days from now. This repository will be used to store my practice and project Dockerfiles.

### P01 Basic Dockerfile
In this project, we create a basic Dockerfile that demonstrates the fundamental instructions to containerize an application. Basic FROM, RUN & CMD instructions.

### P02 Rebuilds with Cache
In this project, we explore the concept of caching in Docker builds to optimize the build process. The Dockerfile used is the same as the one in P01. Cache using the procedure explained with comments.

### P03 NodeJS WebApp Containerized
In this project, we create a simple Node.js web application and containerize it using Docker. 

### P04 NodeJS WebApp with Redis Containerized
In this project, we build a Node.js web application that keeps track of the number of visits to the root route ('/') using Redis as a data store. The application is containerized using Docker, and we also implement the availability of containers using Docker Compose.

### P05 Production Grade Workflow with React App, Docker, Travis CI, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk
This repository contains a production-grade workflow for a React web application, incorporating Docker for containerization, Travis CI for continuous integration, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment. This workflow aims to streamline the development, testing, and deployment process, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for both developers and users.
